	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm efficient quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.
	</p>
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. it has order of O(n)
